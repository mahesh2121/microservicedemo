Creating a Python virtual environment on Ubuntu and installing required packages like Requests and Flask is a straightforward process. Here's a step-by-step guide:

    Install Python:
    Ensure Python is installed on your Ubuntu system. Python is pre-installed on many Ubuntu versions, but you can check its version using the following command:


    python3 --version


If Python is not installed, you can install it using the package manager:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3

Install Python's venv module:
Python's venv module allows you to create virtual environments. If it's not already installed, install it using apt as well:

    sudo apt install python3-venv

Create a project directory:
Choose or create a directory where you want to set up your Python project. Let's say the directory is named my_project. Navigate to this directory in the terminal.

Create a virtual environment:
Inside the project directory, create a Python virtual environment using the venv module:

    python3 -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:
Activate the virtual environment to work within it. This step ensures that any packages you install will only affect this specific environment and not the system-wide Python installation:

    source venv/bin/activate


Install required packages:
With the virtual environment activated, you can now install the required packages like Requests and Flask using pip. Create a requirements.txt file with the required packages and their versions:

Flask==2.0.1
requests==2.26.0


Then, install the packages using pip:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Deactivate the virtual environment:
When you're done working on your project, you can deactivate the virtual environment to return to the system-wide Python environment:

    deactivate


Reactivate the virtual environment (optional):
If you need to work on the project again, navigate to the project directory and reactivate the virtual environment using the source 

    source venv/bin/activate
